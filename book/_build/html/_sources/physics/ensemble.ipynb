    "## What is an Ensemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **classical mechanics**, we describe the state of a system (like a single particle) by its position and momentum. For a system with many particles, say $N$ particles, the state would be given by $3N$ position coordinates and $3N$ momentum coordinates. This $6N$-dimensional space is called **phase space**. Each point in phase space represents a unique microscopic state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we deal with macroscopic systems (like a gas in a room), we have an enormous number of particles (on the order of Avogadro's number, $10^{23}$). It's practically impossible to know the exact microscopic state of such a system at any given time. Even if we could, solving the equations of motion for all those particles would be computationally intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the concept of an **ensemble** comes in. An ensemble is a **collection of a large number of identical systems**, all prepared in the same macroscopic way, but each in a different possible microscopic state consistent with the macroscopic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a box of gas. You know its volume, temperature, and the number of particles. An ensemble would be a vast collection of identical boxes, each with the same volume, temperature, and number of particles, but the individual gas molecules within each box would be in different positions and have different momenta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that if we observe a single macroscopic system over a very long time, it will, on average, visit all the microscopic states consistent with its macroscopic properties. This is called the **ergodic hypothesis**. For practical purposes, instead of waiting for one system to explore all its possible states, we consider a large number of identical systems at a single instant in time. The average over this ensemble is then equivalent to the time average of a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **[Ergodic hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis)**. The ergodic hypothesis, in physics and thermodynamics, essentially states that for a system in thermal equilibrium, the time a system spends in a particular region of its phase space is proportional to the volume of that region. In simpler terms, over a long period, the system will visit all accessible states with equal probability. This allows us to calculate the average behavior of a system by averaging over its states, rather than over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of ensemble used depends on which macroscopic quantities are kept constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Microcanonical Ensemble (NVE):** This ensemble represents an isolated system where the **number of particles ($N$), volume ($V$), and total energy ($E$) are fixed**. All systems in this ensemble have exactly the same energy.\n",
    "* **Canonical Ensemble (NVT):** This ensemble represents a closed system in thermal contact with a heat reservoir. Here, the **number of particles ($N$), volume ($V$), and temperature ($T$) are fixed**. Energy can fluctuate between the system and the reservoir.\n",
    "* **Grand Canonical Ensemble ($\\mu$VT):** This ensemble represents an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir. Here, the **chemical potential $\\mu$, volume $V$, and temperature $T$ are fixed**. Both energy and particle number can fluctuate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will review all these different ensembles in detail a bit later.\n",

    "## Simple Examples to Illustrate Theoretical Material\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Liouville's Theorem - Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 1D simple harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian:\n",
    "$$H(q, p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}kq^2$$\n",
    "The phase space is 2-dimensional ($q, p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton's equations are:\n",
    "$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{p}{m}$$\n",
    "$$\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -kq$$\n",
    "The trajectories in phase space are ellipses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume an initial distribution $\\rho(q, p, 0)$. According to Liouville's theorem, the density $\\rho$ will remain constant along these elliptical trajectories.\n",
    "Suppose you have a cluster of points in phase space representing an ensemble of oscillators. As they evolve, this cluster will deform (stretch and rotate along the ellipses), but its area (volume in 2D phase space) will remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizing Liouville's Theorem:**\n",
    "Imagine drawing a small circle in the $(q,p)$ phase space at $t=0$. As time progresses, each point on that circle follows its own elliptical trajectory. The circle will deform into an ellipse, then a more elongated ellipse, and so on. However, the **area** enclosed by this evolving shape will remain precisely the same. This is the essence of Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Ensemble Average - A System of Two-State Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system of $N$ identical, non-interacting particles. Each particle can be in one of two energy states:\n",
    "* State 0: Energy $E_0 = 0$\n",
    "* State 1: Energy $E_1 = \\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon > 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified system, so we won't use continuous phase space integrals. Instead, we'll use a discrete sum over possible microstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Canonical Ensemble:**\n",
    "Let the system be in thermal contact with a reservoir at temperature $T$. We are in the canonical ensemble.\n",
    "The probability of a single particle being in a state with energy $E_i$ is proportional to $e^{-\\beta E_i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single particle:\n",
    "* Probability of being in State 0 ($P_0$): $P_0 = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_0}}{e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1}} = \\frac{e^0}{e^0 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$\n",
    "* Probability of being in State 1 ($P_1$): $P_1 = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_1}}{e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **partition function for a single particle** is $Z_1 = e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1} = 1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ensemble average energy for a single particle** $\\langle E \\rangle_1$:\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = E_0 P_0 + E_1 P_1$$\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = (0) \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} + (\\epsilon) \\frac{e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} = \\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$$\n",

    "The results match, illustrating the power of the partition function approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system of $N$ non-interacting particles, the total partition function $Z_N = (Z_1)^N$. The total average energy is then $\\langle E \\rangle_N = N \\langle E \\rangle_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembles provide a powerful framework for connecting the microscopic properties of a system to its macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Liouville's theorem ensures the consistency of this approach by describing the conservation of phase space density, and ensemble averages allow us to calculate measurable quantities from the microscopic probability distributions."
