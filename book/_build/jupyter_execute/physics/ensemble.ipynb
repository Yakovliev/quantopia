    "## What is an Ensemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **classical mechanics**, we describe the state of a system (like a single particle) by its position and momentum. For a system with many particles, say $N$ particles, the state would be given by $3N$ position coordinates and $3N$ momentum coordinates. This $6N$-dimensional space is called **phase space**. Each point in phase space represents a unique microscopic state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we deal with macroscopic systems (like a gas in a room), we have an enormous number of particles (on the order of Avogadro's number, $10^{23}$). It's practically impossible to know the exact microscopic state of such a system at any given time. Even if we could, solving the equations of motion for all those particles would be computationally intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the concept of an **ensemble** comes in. An ensemble is a **collection of a large number of identical systems**, all prepared in the same macroscopic way, but each in a different possible microscopic state consistent with the macroscopic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a box of gas. You know its volume, temperature, and the number of particles. An ensemble would be a vast collection of identical boxes, each with the same volume, temperature, and number of particles, but the individual gas molecules within each box would be in different positions and have different momenta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that if we observe a single macroscopic system over a very long time, it will, on average, visit all the microscopic states consistent with its macroscopic properties. This is called the **ergodic hypothesis**. For practical purposes, instead of waiting for one system to explore all its possible states, we consider a large number of identical systems at a single instant in time. The average over this ensemble is then equivalent to the time average of a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **[Ergodic hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis)**. The ergodic hypothesis, in physics and thermodynamics, essentially states that for a system in thermal equilibrium, the time a system spends in a particular region of its phase space is proportional to the volume of that region. In simpler terms, over a long period, the system will visit all accessible states with equal probability. This allows us to calculate the average behavior of a system by averaging over its states, rather than over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of ensemble used depends on which macroscopic quantities are kept constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Microcanonical Ensemble (NVE):** This ensemble represents an isolated system where the **number of particles ($N$), volume ($V$), and total energy ($E$) are fixed**. All systems in this ensemble have exactly the same energy.\n",
    "* **Canonical Ensemble (NVT):** This ensemble represents a closed system in thermal contact with a heat reservoir. Here, the **number of particles ($N$), volume ($V$), and temperature ($T$) are fixed**. Energy can fluctuate between the system and the reservoir.\n",
    "* **Grand Canonical Ensemble ($\\mu$VT):** This ensemble represents an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir. Here, the **chemical potential $\\mu$, volume $V$, and temperature $T$ are fixed**. Both energy and particle number can fluctuate.\n",
