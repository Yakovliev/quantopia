    "## Introduction: The Time Value of Money (TVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Time Value of Money (TVM)** is a foundational principle in finance. It posits that a sum of money available today is inherently worth more than the same sum promised at a future date. This is due to its potential earning capacity. In essence, a dollar in hand today can be invested and grow, whereas a dollar received tomorrow has missed that opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is TVM important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Inflation:** Over time, the purchasing power of money tends to erode due to inflation. A fixed sum of money will buy less in the future than it does today.\n",
    "2.  **Opportunity Cost:** Money available today can be invested or used to generate returns. Delaying the receipt of money means foregoing these potential earnings or opportunities. This foregone return is the opportunity cost.\n",
    "3.  **Risk/Uncertainty:** There is always a degree of risk that future payments might not be received as expected, or that the entity promising them might default. Money in hand today carries less uncertainty than a future promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding TVM is paramount for making financial decisions, from evaluating investment projects and calculating loan payments to personal financial planning. It forms the bedrock for all discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Blocks: Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV)\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the Time Value of Money, we use two inverse but related concepts: Future Value (FV) and Present Value (PV).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Value (FV)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Future Value (FV)** is the value of a current asset at a future date, assuming a specific rate of growth or interest. It answers the question: \"What will my money be worth in the future if I invest it today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple question: If you invest $PV$ dollars today at an interest rate of $r$ per period, how much will you have after $n$ periods? This process is called **compounding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **After 1 period:** You'll have your initial principal plus the interest earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$FV_1 = PV + (PV \\cdot r) = PV \\cdot (1+r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **After 2 periods:** You'll earn interest on the new, larger amount ($FV_1$). This is the magic of compounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$FV_2 = FV_1 \\cdot (1+r) = [PV \\cdot (1+r)] \\cdot (1+r) = PV \\cdot (1+r)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **After n periods:** Following the pattern, the general formula for Future Value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ FV = PV \\cdot (1+r)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You invest $1,000 today ($PV$) at an annual interest rate of 8% ($r$) for 5 years ($n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$FV = 1000 \\cdot (1+0.08)^5 = 1000 \\cdot (1.4693) = 1,469.33$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the final formula is\n",
    "\n",
    "> $$FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "*   $FV$: Future Value (the amount of money at the end of the investment period)\n",
    "*   $PV$: Present Value (the initial amount of money invested today)\n",
    "*   $r$: The annual interest rate, growth rate, or rate of return (expressed as a decimal)\n",
    "*   $n$: The number of periods (typically years) over which the money is invested"

    "### Present Value (PV) - Discounting\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's ask the reverse question: If you are promised $FV$ dollars in $n$ periods, what is the value of that promise *today*, given an interest rate of $r$? This process is called **discounting**, and it's crucial for everything that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive the PV formula simply by rearranging the FV formula. From $FV = PV \\cdot (1+r)^n$, we solve for $PV$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1+r)^n} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad PV = FV \\cdot (1+r)^{-n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $r$ is often called the **discount rate**. It's the rate you use to discount future cash flows back to their present value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You will receive $10,000 in 5 years. If your personal discount rate (the return you could get elsewhere) is 8%, what is that $10,000 worth to you today?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PV = \\frac{10000}{(1+0.08)^5} = \\frac{10000}{1.4693} = 6,805.83$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you would be indifferent between receiving $6,805.83 today and receiving $10,000 in 5 years, assuming an 8% rate of return.\n",

    "## Net Present Value (NPV)\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating an investment project, we rarely deal with a single future sum but rather a series of cash flows occurring at different times. For example, you might invest money today (an outflow), and then receive a series of returns in the following years (inflows). The **Net Present Value (NPV)** is a powerful and fundamental tool in capital budgeting that uses the concept of Present Value to assess the profitability and attractiveness of such a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Net Present Value (NPV)** is the difference between the present value of all cash inflows and the present value of all cash outflows associated with a project over its entire life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convention:**\n",
    "*   **Cash Outflows (Investments):** Represented as negative numbers.\n",
    "*   **Cash Inflows (Returns):** Represented as positive numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial investment at \"time 0\" is denoted as $CF_0$ and is almost always negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, it converts all future cash flows (both positive, representing income, and negative, representing expenses or investments) into their equivalent value today, using a specified discount rate. The initial investment ($CF_0$) is typically a cash outflow and thus negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for NPV is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "*   $CF_t$: The net cash flow (cash inflow minus cash outflow) at time $t$.\n",
    "    *   $CF_0$ represents the initial investment at time $t=0$, which is almost always an outflow and thus a negative value.\n",
    "*   $r$: The discount rate (also known as the hurdle rate, required rate of return, or cost of capital). This rate is of paramount importance as it represents the minimum acceptable rate of return for the project, often reflecting the company's cost of financing (e.g., weighted average cost of capital), the risk profile of the project, and the opportunity cost of investing elsewhere.\n",
    "*   $t$: The time period (e.g., year) when the cash flow occurs. The first cash flow is typically at $t=0$.\n",
    "*   $n$: The total number of periods over the project's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, the cost of capital is the minimum rate of return a company must earn on an investment or project to create value. Think of it as the financial \"break-even\" point for an investment.\n",
    "* If a project earns a return higher than the cost of capital, it creates value for the company and its investors.\n",
    "* If a project earns a return lower than the cost of capital, it destroys value. It would have been better to just pay back the investors their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the cost of capital is often called the \"hurdle rate\" - any new project must \"clear this hurdle\" to be considered worthwhile. This is the rate ($r$) we used in the NPV calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the summation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula means you calculate the present value of each individual cash flow and then sum them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$NPV = \\frac{CF_0}{(1 + r)^0} + \\frac{CF_1}{(1 + r)^1} + \\frac{CF_2}{(1 + r)^2} + \\dots + \\frac{CF_n}{(1 + r)^n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, the first term simplifies to $CF_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision rule for NPV is straightforward and unambiguous:\n",
    "*   If $NPV > 0$: The project is expected to generate more cash than the cost of capital, after accounting for the time value of money. This means the project will increase the wealth of the shareholders. **Accept** the project.\n",
    "*   If $NPV < 0$: The project is expected to generate less cash than the cost of capital, indicating it will destroy shareholder wealth. **Reject** the project.\n",
    "*   If $NPV = 0$: The project is expected to break even, covering the cost of capital exactly. The investor is indifferent between undertaking the project and not."

    "\n",
    "The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is another widely used metric for evaluating the attractiveness of a project or investment. While related to NPV, it provides a different perspective on profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "NPV answers the question: \"Is this a good investment at a *given* discount rate?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** answers a different, but related, question: **\"What is the discount rate at which this investment breaks even?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **IRR** is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project exactly equal to zero. In simpler terms, it is the rate of return an investment is expected to generate. It's the maximum effective interest rate an investment can have before it starts losing money (i.e., having a negative NPV).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula (Implicit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike NPV, there is no direct algebraic formula to explicitly calculate IRR. Instead, IRR is the specific value of $IRR$ that satisfies the following equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is essentially the NPV formula, but with the NPV set to zero and $IRR$ as the unknown discount rate we are solving for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $IRR$ appears in the denominator and as an exponent, this equation is not algebraically solvable for most projects (especially those with more than two cash flows). We need to employ iterative numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method, which we will discuss for XIRR) to efficiently find the IRR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision rule for IRR is:\n",
    "*   If $IRR > r$: Where $r$ is the required rate of return (hurdle rate or cost of capital), the project's expected return exceeds the minimum acceptable return. **Accept** the project.\n",
    "*   If $IRR < r$: The project's expected return is less than the cost of capital. **Reject** the project.\n",
    "*   If $IRR = r$: The project's expected return exactly equals the cost of capital. The investor is indifferent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (continued from NPV example):** For the project with $CF_0 = -10,000$, $CF_1 = 4,000$, $CF_2 = 5,000$, and $CF_3 = 6,000$. We need to find the $IRR$ such that:\n",

    "**Limitations of IRR**\n",
    "\n",
    "While intuitive, IRR has several limitations that can make it less reliable than NPV in certain situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Assumes Regular Intervals:** The standard IRR formula implicitly assumes that all cash flows occur at equally spaced intervals (e.g., annually, semi-annually). This is often an unrealistic simplification in real-world projects. What if you invest on Jan 5th, get a dividend on March 20th, invest more on Sep 1st, and sell everything two years later on Dec 18th? For this, we need a more flexible tool.\n",
    "2.  **Reinvestment Assumption:** IRR implicitly assumes that all intermediate positive cash flows generated by the project are reinvested at the *calculated IRR itself* until the end of the project's life. This can be a highly unrealistic assumption, especially if the calculated IRR is very high or very low, as it's unlikely that a firm can consistently find other projects with the exact same rate of return to reinvest these funds.\n",
    "3.  **Multiple IRRs:** For projects with \"non-conventional\" cash flow patterns (i.e., cash flows that switch signs more than once, e.g., an initial outflow, followed by inflows, then another outflow), it's mathematically possible to have multiple real IRRs, making the interpretation ambiguous and the decision rule unreliable.\n",
    "4.  **Mutually Exclusive Projects:** When comparing mutually exclusive projects (where choosing one automatically precludes choosing the others), IRR can sometimes lead to different decisions than NPV, especially when projects differ significantly in scale, project life, or the timing of cash flows. In such cases, NPV is generally preferred because it directly measures the absolute increase in firm value."

    "When choosing among mutually exclusive projects, the goal is to select the project that adds the most value to the firm. NPV directly measures this absolute increase in wealth. A project with a higher IRR might not necessarily have the highest NPV if it's a smaller project or if its cash flows are front-loaded, leading to a higher percentage return on a smaller base.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two projects with a cost of capital of 10%:\n",
    "*   **Project A:** Initial investment $-1,000$, Year 1 cash flow $1,500$. IRR = 50%, NPV = $363.64$ (NPV is selected just to be an example; NPV and IRR values are independent; in this specific example, we do not have enough data to calculate NPV).\n",
    "*   **Project B:** Initial investment $-10,000$, Year 1 cash flow $12,000$. IRR = 20%, NPV = $909.09$ (NPV is selected just to be an example; NPV and IRR values are independent; in this specific example, we do not have enough data to calculate NPV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Project A has a much higher IRR, but Project B has a significantly higher NPV. If these are mutually exclusive, Project B should be chosen because it adds more absolute value to the firm, despite its lower percentage return. The discrepancy often arises from the differing reinvestment rate assumptions (IRR assumes reinvestment at the project's own rate, while NPV assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital). Therefore, for choosing among alternatives that cannot all be undertaken, NPV is the superior metric."

    "## Addressing Limitations: Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary limitation that the **Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR)** addresses is the assumption of regularly spaced cash flows inherent in the standard IRR calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world investments and projects do not have cash flows that occur at precise, equally spaced intervals (e.g., exactly annually or semi-annually). Examples include:\n",
    "*   Irregular contributions or withdrawals from an investment portfolio.\n",
    "*   Project expenses or revenues that occur on specific, non-annual dates.\n",
    "*   Private equity investments with multiple capital calls and distributions over varying timeframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard IRR would require approximations or complex adjustments to handle such irregular timings, leading to inaccuracies. XIRR provides a robust solution by incorporating the **exact dates** of each cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR)** is a financial metric used to calculate the annualized internal rate of return for a series of cash flows that are not necessarily periodic. It accounts for the actual, specific dates of each cash flow, providing a more accurate annualized rate of return for investments with irregular timings. Like IRR, XIRR is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of a series of cash flows equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XIRR is the value of $r$ that satisfies the equation:\n",

    "*   $C_i$: The $i$-th cash flow amount. This series must include at least one negative cash flow (typically an initial investment or contribution) and at least one positive cash flow (a return or distribution).\n",
    "*   $D_i$: The date of the $i$-th cash flow. These dates must be actual calendar dates.\n",
    "*   $D_1$: The date of the **earliest** cash flow in the series. This date serves as the reference point (effectively \"time $t=0$\") for all other cash flows in the calculation.\n",
    "*   $(D_i - D_1)$: Represents the number of days between the $i$-th cash flow date and the first (earliest) cash flow date.\n",
    "*   $/365$: Divides the number of days by $365$ to convert the time difference into a fractional number of years. This uses a common **day count convention** known as \"Actual/365 Fixed\" (or \"Actual/365\"). In this convention, the actual number of days between two dates is used in the numerator, and a fixed denominator of 365 days is used for annualization, regardless of whether it's a leap year. This simplification ensures consistency across calculations, though other day count conventions (like Actual/Actual or 30/360) are used in specific financial markets (e.g., bond pricing). Some models use 365.25 for leap years, but 365 is standard in most spreadsheet functions.\n",
    "*   $N$: The total number of cash flows in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Indexing:** When applying this formula, the first cash flow $C_1$ (corresponding to date $D_1$) will have an exponent of $(D_1 - D_1)/365 = 0$. Consequently, its term in the summation will be $C_1 / (1+r)^0 = C_1$. All subsequent cash flows are then discounted back to this initial reference date $D_1$."

    "    *   These dates must be valid Google Sheets date formats (e.g., entered as `DATE(YYYY,MM,DD)`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, or recognized date serial numbers).\n",
    "    *   For clarity and to prevent potential internal sorting issues, it is best practice to provide the dates in chronological order, although the function often handles unsorted dates by implicitly sorting them.\n",
    "*   `[guess]`: This is an optional argument. It is an estimate for the XIRR, expressed as a decimal (e.g., $0.1$ for $10\\%$).\n",
    "    *   If omitted, Google Sheets uses a default guess (typically $0.1$ or $10\\%$).\n",
    "    *   Providing a reasonable guess can be critically important. It helps the iterative numerical algorithm converge faster and, more importantly, helps to find the most economically meaningful solution, especially in cases of unusual or complex cash flow patterns where multiple mathematical solutions (IRRs) might exist. If the function returns an error (e.g., `#NUM!`) or an unexpected result, trying a different `guess` is often the first troubleshooting step.\n",

    "## Important Considerations for XIRR\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Annualized Rate:** XIRR always returns an annualized rate, regardless of the frequency of cash flows or the total duration of the investment. This is a key feature, allowing for direct comparison with other annualized investment returns (e.g., bond yields, stock market returns).\n",
    "2.  **Reinvestment Assumption:** Like standard IRR, XIRR implicitly assumes that all positive cash flows generated by the project are reinvested at the *calculated XIRR rate* until the end of the project. This can be a strong and often unrealistic assumption, as finding consistent reinvestment opportunities at the project's exact rate of return can be challenging.\n",
    "    *   **Addressing the Reinvestment Assumption: Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR):** To overcome the unrealistic reinvestment assumption of IRR/XIRR, the **Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)** was developed. MIRR assumes that all positive cash flows are reinvested at a more realistic rate, typically the firm's cost of capital or a specific financing rate. All negative cash flows are discounted to the present at the firm's financing rate, while positive cash flows are compounded to the project's end at the reinvestment rate, resulting in a terminal value. This terminal value is then discounted back to the present at the cost of capital to find a single, more realistic rate of return.\n",
    "3.  **Data Quality:** The accuracy and reliability of the XIRR calculation are critically dependent on the accuracy of both the cash flow amounts and, especially, their corresponding dates. Even minor errors in dates can significantly distort the resulting XIRR.\n",
    "4.  **At Least One Negative and One Positive Cash Flow:** The XIRR function requires a mix of cash flow signs (at least one negative and at least one positive) to find a meaningful rate. If all cash flows are positive (e.g., just receiving money without an initial investment) or all are negative (e.g., only making investments without any return), XIRR will typically return an error (e.g., `#NUM!` in Google Sheets) or an undefined result, as a rate of return cannot be calculated in such scenarios.\n",
    "5.  **Chronological Order of Dates:** While spreadsheet functions like Google Sheets' XIRR might internally sort the provided dates, it is always best practice to arrange your cash flow dates and corresponding amounts in strict chronological order. This improves readability, ensures clarity, and helps prevent potential unexpected behavior or errors in complex datasets.\n",
    "6.  **Multiple Solutions / No Real Solution:** For unusual cash flow patterns that involve multiple sign changes (e.g., initial outflow, then inflows, then another outflow, and then more inflows), it is theoretically possible for the underlying XIRR equation to have multiple real solutions or, in some cases, no real solution. This is where the optional `[guess]` argument becomes particularly important. By providing a reasonable `guess`, you can help the numerical algorithm converge to the most appropriate or economically meaningful solution, or even find a solution when the default guess might fail.\n",
    "7.  **Day Count Convention (Actual/365 Fixed):** As discussed, the XIRR formula's use of `/365` implies the \"Actual/365 Fixed\" day count convention. This means the numerator uses the exact number of days between two dates, while the denominator is a fixed 365 days for annualization, ignoring leap years. This convention is common in many financial calculations for simplicity and consistency.\n",
