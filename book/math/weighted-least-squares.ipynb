                "\n",
                "**Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** is a variation of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. In OLS, it's assumed that the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all observations. This assumption is called **homoscedasticity**. However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption doesn't hold; the errors might be larger for some observations than for others. This situation is called **heteroscedasticity**.\n",
                "\n",
                "When heteroscedasticity is present, OLS gives equal weight to all data points. This can lead to inefficient parameter estimates (meaning the estimates are not the most precise possible) and incorrect standard errors, which in turn affect the reliability of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",
                "\n",
                "WLS addresses this by assigning different **weights** to each data point in the regression. The goal of WLS is to minimize the sum of the *weighted* squared residuals:\n",

                "NOTE: For additional statistical context, Weighted Least Squares is a special case of a broader method known as Generalized Least Squares (GLS). GLS is designed for situations where the errors are either heteroscedastic (have non-constant variance) or are correlated with each other. WLS simplifies the GLS framework by assuming that the errors, while having different variances, are not correlated with one another. This means the covariance matrix of the errors is a diagonal matrix, which makes the calculations more straightforward than in the full GLS approach.\n",
