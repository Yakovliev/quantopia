    "**AIC assumes that the \"true\" data-generating process is infinitely complex and therefore unknowable.** We can only ever hope to approximate it with our models.\n",

In simpler terms, it's about building the model that will give you the most accurate predictions on a new, unseen dataset.\n",

    "The core idea of MLE is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, $L(\\theta|x)$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters and $x$ is the data. The likelihood function is often a product of probability density functions (or probability mass functions) for each data point. For a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations, the likelihood is:\n",

    "The connection between Maximum Likelihood and regression modeling becomes clear when we make assumptions about the distribution of the errors. While Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals, MLE provides a more general framework that can lead to the same result under specific conditions.\n",

    "## Derivation of the Log-Likelihood for Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is a very useful formula for the log-likelihood ($\\ln(L)$) that we can use for our case. It's derived by making one key assumption: that the errors (the residuals) follow a normal distribution. This is the same underlying assumption that allows us to use least squares methods in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the derivation (note that we derive all the formulas under the assumption that we know exact values of $\\sigma_i$ or $\\sigma$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start with the probability of one data point.** We assume that the probability of observing a single data point $(x_i, y_i)$ given the model's prediction $f(x_i, \\beta)$ is described by a normal distribution with a mean of $f(x_i, \\beta)$ and a standard deviation of $\\sigma_i$. This is equivalent to the assumption that the error terms $\\epsilon_i$ are independently distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance $\\sigma_i^2$, so $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_i^2)$ (remember that $y_i = f(x_i, \\beta) + \\epsilon_i$).

    "\n",
    "2.  **Form the likelihood function.** Assuming each data point is an independent measurement, the total likelihood ($L$) of observing all $n$ data points is the product of their individual probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$L = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p(y_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_i^2}} e^{-\\frac{(y_i - f(x_i, \\beta))^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}} \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "5. The second term in this equation is directly related to our Chi-Squared ($\\chi^2$) statistic. Since $\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i - f(x_i, \\beta))^2}{\\sigma_i^2}$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n",

The sum of squared residuals, $SSR$, is a good starting point, but simply dividing by $n$ would give us a biased estimate. The reason for this is that we use the sample data to estimate the regression coefficients (the slope and intercept), which forces the residuals to have a mean of zero. This constraint means the residuals are not truly independent.\n",

    "By dividing by the **degrees of freedom**, $n - k - 1$, instead of just $n$, we correct for this bias. The degrees of freedom represent the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. In linear regression, once you've estimated the intercept and the slopes (a total of $k+1$ parameters), the values of the residuals are no longer entirely free to vary. Therefore, dividing by $n - k - 1$ provides an **unbiased estimator** of the true population variance, $\\sigma^2$."
