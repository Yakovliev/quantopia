    "Consider a completely **isolated** physical system containing $N$ particles with total energy $E$ confined within volume $V$. Such a system operates under strict isolation conditions, meaning it cannot exchange either matter or energy with its environment. Think of it as a snapshot of all possible microscopic arrangements (called **microstates**) a system can have when its total energy, volume, and number of particles are fixed.\n",

    "\n",
    "This relationship yields a time-independent $\\rho(q, p)$, which aligns perfectly with ergodic theory principles and the fundamental postulate that all accessible microstates possess equal a priori probabilities. The **probability distribution function** ($\\rho(q, p)$) describes the likelihood of finding the system in a particular microstate. For an isolated system in equilibrium, this probability *only* depends on the system's total energy ($H(q, p)$ represents the system's total energy, also called the Hamiltonian). It doesn't change over time, meaning $\\frac{d \\rho(q, p)}{dt} = 0$. This stability is a hallmark of equilibrium.\n",
