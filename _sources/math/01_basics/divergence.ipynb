    "\n",
    "The **divergence** of a vector field is a scalar function that measures the rate at which the vector field \"spreads out\" from a given point. Mathematically, for a vector field $\\vec{F} = F_x\\,\\hat{i} + F_y\\,\\hat{j} + F_z\\,\\hat{k}$ in three-dimensional space, the divergence is defined as:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\nabla$ (del operator) is a vector differential operator, and the dot denotes the dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The velocity of the air at each point defines a vector field. While air is heated in a region, it expands in all directions, and thus the velocity field points outward from that region. The divergence of the velocity field in that region would thus have a positive value. While the air is cooled and thus contracting, the divergence of the velocity has a negative value.\n"

    "### Physical Meaning of Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Intuitive Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Divergence:** Indicates a \"source\" at that point where the field vectors are spreading out. For example, in fluid flow, it represents a point where fluid is being added.\n",
    "- **Negative Divergence:** Indicates a \"sink\" where the field vectors are converging. In fluid flow, it's a point where fluid is being removed.\n",
    "- **Zero Divergence:** The field is **solenoidal** (volume-preserving flow), meaning there's no net addition or removal at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fluid Dynamics:** Incompressible fluids have a divergence of zero ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0$), meaning the fluid density remains constant, and there's no net flow into or out of any point.\n",
    "- **Electromagnetism:** Gauss's law relates the divergence of the electric field to the charge density:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  This indicates that charges act as sources or sinks of the electric field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a vector field representing airflow. At points where air is emanating (like from a fan), the divergence is positive. Where air is being sucked in (like into a vacuum cleaner), the divergence is negative. In regions where air flows uniformly without any accumulation or depletion, the divergence is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divergence** quantifies the \"spreading out\" of a vector field from a point.\n",
    "- It is calculated as the sum of the partial derivatives of the vector field's components with respect to their corresponding coordinates.\n",
    "- Physically, it represents the net rate of \"outflow\" per unit volume at a point, indicating sources or sinks in the field.\n",
