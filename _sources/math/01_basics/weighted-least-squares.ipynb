    "## What is Weighted Least Squares (WLS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** is a variation of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. In OLS, it's assumed that the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all observations. This assumption is called **homoscedasticity**. However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption doesn't hold; the errors might be larger for some observations than for others. This situation is called **heteroscedasticity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When heteroscedasticity is present, OLS gives equal weight to all data points. This can lead to inefficient parameter estimates (meaning the estimates are not the most precise possible) and incorrect standard errors, which in turn affect the reliability of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "WLS addresses this by assigning different **weights** to each data point in the regression. The goal of WLS is to minimize the sum of the *weighted* squared residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - f(x_i, \\beta))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $w_i$ is the weight for the $i$-th data point.\n",
    "* $y_i$ is the observed dependent variable for the $i$-th point.\n",
    "* $f(x_i, \\beta)$ is the predicted value from the model for the $i$-th point, with parameters $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are weights determined?**\n",
    "The weights are typically inversely proportional to the variance of the errors for each observation. If $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the error for the $i$-th observation, then the weight $w_i$ is usually $1/\\sigma_i^2$. This means:\n",
    "* Observations with smaller errors (lower variance) get larger weights, influencing the fit more.\n",
    "* Observations with larger errors (higher variance) get smaller weights, influencing the fit less."

    "## Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental sciences and data analysis, observations are inherently subject to **measurement uncertainty**. This uncertainty reflects the lack of perfect knowledge about the true value of a quantity due to limitations of instruments, environmental variations, or inherent stochastic processes. In our case of the regression analysis and statistics, we may also call it as an \"error\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation ($\\sigma$)** is the most common statistical measure used to quantify the spread or dispersion of a set of data points around their mean. In the context of individual experimental measurements, the standard deviation of a measurement (or its uncertainty) refers to the expected variability if that measurement were to be repeated multiple times under identical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a measurement $Y$ is reported as $Y \\pm \\delta Y$, where $\\delta Y$ represents the uncertainty, this $\\delta Y$ is frequently taken to be the **standard deviation** of that measurement. It implies that approximately 68.3% of repeated measurements would fall within the range $[Y - \\delta Y, Y + \\delta Y]$, assuming a normal distribution of errors."

    "* **$x_i$ (Independent Variable):** Typically assumed to be known precisely, or to have negligible uncertainty compared to $y_i$.\n",
    "* **$y_i$ (Dependent Variable):** This value is considered the **best estimate** (or the sample mean) of the true underlying value of the dependent variable at $x_i$. This implies that if multiple independent measurements of $y$ were taken at $x_i$, $y_i$ would represent their average, aiming to minimize random errors.\n",
    "* **$\\sigma_i$ (Uncertainty/Standard Deviation of $y_i$):** This parameter, provided to the fitting algorithm (e.g., via the `sigma` argument in `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`), quantifies the **standard deviation of the measurement $y_i$**. It reflects the precision with which $y_i$ was determined. A smaller $\\sigma_i$ indicates a more precise (less uncertain) measurement, and vice-versa.\n"
