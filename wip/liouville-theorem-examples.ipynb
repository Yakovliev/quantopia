    "### 1. A Single Particle in a One-Dimensional Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a single particle of mass $m$ moving freely in a one-dimensional box of length $L$.\n",
    "* Position: $q$\n",
    "* Momentum: $p$\n",
    "* Phase space is 2-dimensional ($q, p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian is simply the kinetic energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton's equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{p}{m}$$\n",
    "$$\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these, we see that $p$ is constant (momentum is conserved), and $q$ changes linearly with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's visualize a small square region in phase space at time $t=0$, say with $q$ ranging from $q_0$ to $q_0 + \\Delta q$ and $p$ ranging from $p_0$ to $p_0 + \\Delta p$. The area of this square is $\\Delta q \\Delta p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time progresses:\n",
    "* The $q$ coordinates will shift by $\\dot{q} \\Delta t = (p/m) \\Delta t$. Points with higher $p$ will move faster in the $q$ direction.\n",
    "* The $p$ coordinates remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the square will transform into a parallelogram. However, the *height* of the parallelogram in the $p$ direction remains $\\Delta p$, and the *width* in the $q$ direction remains $\\Delta q$. The area of the parallelogram is still base times height, which is $\\Delta q \\Delta p$. The volume (area in this 2D case) in phase space is conserved. The initial density of points within that square will be maintained within the evolving parallelogram.\n",

    "### 2. Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and spring constant $k$.\n",
    "* Position: $q$\n",
    "* Momentum: $p$\n",
    "* Phase space is 2-dimensional ($q, p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian is:\n",

    "$$\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -k q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectories in phase space for a simple harmonic oscillator are ellipses (or circles for appropriately scaled axes), corresponding to constant energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a small circular cluster of phase points at $t=0$. As time evolves, each point in the cluster will follow its elliptical trajectory. The entire cluster will rotate and distort its shape, but the area enclosed by the cluster (the phase space volume it occupies) will remain constant. The density of points within that evolving region stays the same. The \"fluid\" of phase points simply flows, stretching and squeezing, but never compressing or expanding in volume.\n"

    "In the canonical ensemble, the probability density function is given by:\n",
    "$$\\rho(q, p) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta H(q, p)}$$\n",
    "where $Z$ is the **canonical partition function** (a normalization constant) and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ ($k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature).\n",

    "The average energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is then:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} = \\int (-H) e^{-\\beta H} dqdp = - \\int H e^{-\\beta H} dqdp$$\n",

    "## Simple Examples to Illustrate Theoretical Material\n",

    "### Example 1: Liouville's Theorem - Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 1D simple harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian:\n",
    "$$H(q, p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}kq^2$$\n",
    "The phase space is 2-dimensional ($q, p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton's equations are:\n",
    "$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{p}{m}$$\n",
    "$$\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -kq$$\n",
    "The trajectories in phase space are ellipses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume an initial distribution $\\rho(q, p, 0)$. According to Liouville's theorem, the density $\\rho$ will remain constant along these elliptical trajectories.\n",
    "Suppose you have a cluster of points in phase space representing an ensemble of oscillators. As they evolve, this cluster will deform (stretch and rotate along the ellipses), but its area (volume in 2D phase space) will remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizing Liouville's Theorem:**\n",
    "Imagine drawing a small circle in the $(q,p)$ phase space at $t=0$. As time progresses, each point on that circle follows its own elliptical trajectory. The circle will deform into an ellipse, then a more elongated ellipse, and so on. However, the **area** enclosed by this evolving shape will remain precisely the same. This is the essence of Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Ensemble Average - A System of Two-State Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system of $N$ identical, non-interacting particles. Each particle can be in one of two energy states:\n",
    "* State 0: Energy $E_0 = 0$\n",
    "* State 1: Energy $E_1 = \\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon > 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified system, so we won't use continuous phase space integrals. Instead, we'll use a discrete sum over possible microstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Canonical Ensemble:**\n",
    "Let the system be in thermal contact with a reservoir at temperature $T$. We are in the canonical ensemble.\n",
    "The probability of a single particle being in a state with energy $E_i$ is proportional to $e^{-\\beta E_i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single particle:\n",
    "* Probability of being in State 0 ($P_0$): $P_0 = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_0}}{e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1}} = \\frac{e^0}{e^0 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$\n",
    "* Probability of being in State 1 ($P_1$): $P_1 = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_1}}{e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **partition function for a single particle** is $Z_1 = e^{-\\beta E_0} + e^{-\\beta E_1} = 1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ensemble average energy for a single particle** $\\langle E \\rangle_1$:\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = E_0 P_0 + E_1 P_1$$\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = (0) \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} + (\\epsilon) \\frac{e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} = \\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, using the partition function method:\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = - \\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_1}{\\partial \\beta}$$\n",
    "$$\\ln Z_1 = \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_1}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} \\cdot (-\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) = -\\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$$\n",
    "So,\n",
    "$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = - \\left( -\\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}} \\right) = \\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}{1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}$$\n",
    "The results match, illustrating the power of the partition function approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system of $N$ non-interacting particles, the total partition function $Z_N = (Z_1)^N$. The total average energy is then $\\langle E \\rangle_N = N \\langle E \\rangle_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembles provide a powerful framework for connecting the microscopic properties of a system to its macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Liouville's theorem ensures the consistency of this approach by describing the conservation of phase space density, and ensemble averages allow us to calculate measurable quantities from the microscopic probability distributions."
