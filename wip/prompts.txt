Could you please rewrite the material below and explain it in more clear way probably with some simple examples?

Could you please carefully search for information (find some links to the good sources) and validate the following information whether it is correct or not? Look for any typos as well. Validate what should be improved or clarified (this is one chapter from my document):

Below I provide material from a textbook (or even several textbooks). What I want you to do is
1. Determine the main topic of the material
2. Make a list of keywords/phrases/terms/formulas related to this material (based on the material provided). I just need a list of keywords in one column. That's all I need. If you see that additional keywords can be added to this, then add them as well, but in a separate list "additionally".
3. If there are any formulas you did not mentioned previously, please add them into a separate list with title "Formulas". Do not skip any formulas from the text. Add all of them into this section.

Later I will use these keywords/formulas for detailed materials for my lecture, which is why I need just a list, not detailed definitions.

Could you please explain the material on the following topic in detail:
__________________

I am interested in a detailed explanation at a university level.

If there are any formulas that are derived rather than just defined, please provide the mathematical/physical derivation for those formulas.

Also, provide examples or analogies if needed.

If you are defining physical quantities (i.e., new definitions), please also include their units of measurement in the SI system.

In the provided material, please use a friendly but professional style, using the word 'we.' This is because we will be going through this material together ('we' being you, me, and the students who will read this later).

Regarding formatting, you can use headings of the first three levels, but no more (i.e., you can use #, ##, and ### for headings, but you cannot use ####). If you need to use a horizontal line, use the symbols ---, not ***.
One more detail regarding formatting: when there is a statement or term followed by its notation (usually a formula), do not use parentheses for the formula. For example, here's how not to do it: Velocity is constant ($\vec{v} = \text{const}$). And here's how to do it: Velocity is constant $\vec{v} = \text{const}$.
For new formulas or for the derivation of new formulas, use the double dollar sign ($$) so the formulas are nicely centered.

We need to thoroughly understand the topic. Here are some approximate keywords I have compiled, but this may be an incomplete list (feel free to add additional material if necessary):



=====

Here is the material from the previous page, which is already finalized on my website. This is just for your context, so that you understand what has already been covered in detail in the previous material, and what still needs to be added.
And it will also give an understanding of what terms we use.

What title should I give this material?
=====

Based on the material provided, find me pages on Wikipedia that relate to this material provided. I am only interested in the Ukrainian version of Wikipedia and the English version of Wikipedia. Where possible, provide both options (both the Ukrainian and English versions with links)

Here is my material:

Can you please analyze the information/material I provide below in detail? Find the link to the relevant material to check my material so that I can be sure that it is correct. Validate whether the information I provide is correct or not.

Find any typos or minor errors. Write to me what can be improved or clarified.


===============


Can you make me a markdown table that will summarize the entire topic covered, including formulas? I just want to have some kind of visual summary. It is desirable that the table has either 2 or 3 columns, but no more.

Another small detail regarding formatting: when there is a statement or term, followed by the designation of this statement (usually this is followed by a formula), then do not use parentheses for the formula. Here is an example of what not to do: Velocity is constant ($\vec{v} = \text{const}$). And here is an example of what to do: Velocity is constant $\vec{v} = \text{const}$.
